## What is `dc`?

From the [wikipedia][wikidc] article:

[wikidc]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dc_(computer_program)

> `dc` is a cross-platform reverse-polish desk calculator which supports arbitrary-precision arithmetic. It is one of the oldest Unix utilities, predating even the invention of the C programming language; like other utilities of that vintage, it has a powerful set of features but an extremely terse syntax.

## What are you doing with it?

Solving [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/) problems.

## Is that even possible?

Maybe.  I think so.  For some of them, at least.

`dc` *is* just an old calculator, but it can evaluate named strings of commands conditionally.  That probably makes it [Turing Complete](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_complete) or something.

## Is this project useful?

No, not in the least.

## Um, why then?

Because there's something oddly appealing about a "language" more opaque than perl.

## How do I run the examples?

`dc` from a terminal to start interactive mode, then just copy and paste.
